# Minty
Minty, is an application website for Tea lovers. By HTML &amp; CSS and Bootstrap 5

A landing webpage for a Tea application which shows the features of the tea, the costumers' reviews, and the services that the application offers. Furthermore, for this webpage, I used HTML and CSS with the framework Bootstrap 5, which made the process of making the webpage more easier and with a lot of features.
